# TV-Documentaries-Series-Graphics

The included graphics and xml files will allow a user to consolidate all their documentaries into a single entry in their Kodi or Plex library.

General Usage:

1. Download the repository to your computer.

2. Edit the data in the nfo files to reflect the information you want to have displayed.

**Notes on nfo files:** 

***Plex Users***

Plex does not support the use of nfo files to provide episode and series information. You can skip Step 2.

***Kodi Users***

The *tvshow.nfo* is used to provide information on the entire series. 

The *individual episode.nfo* file is used to provide information for a single episode within your series. Each video needs to have its own seperate nfo file. Make sure the you rename the nfo file to match the name of its video file. If you do not do this, Kodi will not scrape the information into your library.

3. Organize your documentaries in the following manner. Folder names are in bold and file names are in italics.

Do this for as many "Seasons" as you would like to have. Both Kodi and Plex will use the *banner, fanart,* and *poster* files in the **Documentaries** directory as the artwork for your newly created "Documentaries" TV series.

4. Tell Kodi and Plex what artwrok to use for each of the TV Show's seasons.
